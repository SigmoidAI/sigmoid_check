## Contributing to Sigmoid_Check

Recommended Python version: 3.10

Welcome to the **Sigmoid_Check** repository! This guide outlines the process of contributing to our Python library, which automates homework verification. Please read and follow the steps carefully to ensure smooth collaboration.

### 1. Access Permission
This repository is private, and only those with the necessary permissions can access it. If you have access, you can create branches and make contributions.

### 2. Working on a Ticket 

#### Step 1: Create a Branch
1. Navigate to the **GitHub Projects** section where tickets are listed.
2. Select the ticket you will be working on.
3. Use the **Create Branch** button available within the ticket to automatically generate a branch with the correct name.
4. Checkout the newly created branch locally using the following command:
   ```bash
   git checkout <branch_name>
   ```

#### Step 2: Implement Changes
1. Make your changes locally on the checked-out branch.
2. Ensure your code follows PEP 8 standards and is properly tested.

### 3. Create a Pull Request (PR)
1. Once your changes are implemented and tested, push your branch to the repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```
2. Navigate to GitHub and create a **Pull Request** (PR) from your branch.
3. Assign **Eduard Balamatiuc** (`eduard-balamatiuc`) as the reviewer.
4. If needed, add any additional reviewers requested by the team.

### 4. Review and Update
1. After submitting the PR, wait for the code review.
2. Implement any feedback or changes requested by the reviewers.
3. Once all changes are approved, the PR will be ready to merge.

### 5. Merging the PR
1. Once approved, merge the PR into the main branch.
2. After merging, deployment to PyPi will need to be handled manually until we automate the process.

### 6. PyPi Deployment
1. Contact **Eduard Balamatiuc** (`eduard-balamatiuc`) to handle version updates and PyPi deployment.
2. Ensure the version number is correctly updated to reflect the latest changes.

### 7. Updating the Documentation
If the deployment process is automated in the future, this documentation will be updated to reflect the changes. Please check back for any updates.
